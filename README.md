# pyBitConverter
A console based program written in Python to convert Binary, Hexadecimal and Decimal numbers to other formats.
## About
This program is a basic converter that supports the follow conversions:
* Hexadecimal to integer
* Hexadecimal to binary
* Integer to binary
* Integer to hexadecimal
* Binary to integer
* Binary to hexadecimal

This is all achieved without using python's built in functions to convert or 'cast' like hex()

This was created as part of my final project for **Program Essentials with Python SE116.01**
